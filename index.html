        My first project
    </title>
    <p>Visual Studio is an Integrated Development Environment(IDE) developed by Microsoft to develop GUI(Graphical User
        Interface), console, Web applications, web apps, mobile apps, cloud, and web services, etc. With the help of
        this IDE, you can create managed code as well as native code</p>
    <p>In computer technology, a console can mean different things depending on the context. It usually means a
        combination of a display monitor and an input device, usually a keyboard and mouse pair, which allows a user to
        input commands and receive visual output from a computer or computer system.</p>
